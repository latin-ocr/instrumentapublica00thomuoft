Swa thai consentyd than

 

And mad upon this a regman
With mony selis of lordis, thare
That that tyme at this trette wara—Chron. i. p. 219.

In his account of the conferenee and eompact between Bruce and
the Red Comyn at Perth, in the year 1304, Henry the Minstrel
repeatedly applies the term ragment to what, Fordun describes as
“ conventio hinc inde facta ac fide media, interpositis juramentis, per

⁶⁶ suas indenturas, cum appositione sigillorum eorundem roborata.’'

The Bruce and he completyt furth thar bandis ;
Syn that samyn nycht thai sellyt with thar handis.
This ragment left the Bruce with Cumyn thar,
W'ith king Edward haym in England can far :

And thar remaynyt quhill this rag-ment war knawin,
Thre yer and mar or Bruce persewyt his awin.

Sum men demys that Cumyn that ragment send;

Sum men tharfor agaynys makis defend.
Wallace, b. x. v. 1147.

In these instances, the import of the term is obviously the same as
in the passages previously quoted from History and Record3 but in
other authors, of a sornewhat later date, the word occurs in a much
more vague and general sense. Thus in various passages of the

prologues to the translation of Virgil’s AEneid by Gavin Douglas:

Gif 1 had not bene to ane boundis consueuit,
Of my bad wit perchance Ι thocht have fenit
In ryme an rag-men twise als curiouse,

Bot not be twenty part sa sentencius.—Prqface, p. 8, 242
