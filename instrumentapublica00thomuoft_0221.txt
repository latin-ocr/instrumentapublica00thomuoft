torm) Fyvie Castle, (Fyvin chanch) Banff, (Banet clausach) Cullen, (laureolam)
till he reached the district of the Enyie‚ on the eastern bank of the Spey, (Iennoy
sur la riviere de Spe,) does not seem to require any illustration. Having crossed
that river into the country of Moray, on Wednesday the 25th of J uly, he is stated to
have rested at the manour of Rapenache, (Rapenacke manoir en le pays de Moreve,)

a name of which no trace has been found.

’ On the following day, Edward reached the extreme point of his northern expedition,
at Elgin, (la cite deigz‘n,) where he remained till Sunday the 29th‚ when on his
return, he stopped at Rothes on the western bank of the Spey, (Roseise manoir‚) and
on Monday at Invercharrach, (Ynterkeracke,) a small hamlet in the mountains be-
tween Strath-Fiddich and Strath-Doveran, situated on a streamlet of the same name
which falls into the river Doveran, three miles to the north of the parish kirk of
Cabrach. On the following day he reached the castle of Kildrummy, (Kyndrokyn
chat-leb) where he rested on Wednesday, the lst of August3 and on Thursday, is
stated in the Itinerary to have arrived at the Hospital of Kincardine in the Mearns,
(lospital de Kyncardyn en Mernes,) a palpable mistake for Kincardine O’Neil in
Aberdeenshire, about eighteen miles from Kildrummy, and where alone there existed an
Hospital. On the next day, Friday the sd, it seems probable that he reached the other
Kincardine in the Mearns, and proceeded, on Saturday the 4th, to Brechin, (la cite
de Breghym) thence to Aberbrothock, (labaye de Berbrodoclz) to Dundee, to Baligerny‚
the castle of Sir Robert Cambron, situated in the Carse of Gowry, (Baligarnach le
roge Ostama) and to Perth. His subsequent course through the county of Fife‚
along the northern banks of the Forth, and from Stirling onwards to Berwick, requires

no illustration.

As the purpose of these desultory remarks has not been to discuss any of the contro-
verted or doubtful points of history connected with this eventful expedition, but
merely to ascertain the successive stages of the route detailed in this anclent Itinerary,
it is hoped that their minuteness wiu be pardoned, at least by the few who take an in-

terest in such inquiries.
