tain range where the rivers Liddel and Jed have their sources, there are the vestiges of
a Roman road, called the Wheel-causeway, or the Wheel-rig, and near to which are the
remains of a Peel or small castellated house of the same name 3 and that this was the
Wyel of the Itinerary‚ and the resting place of Edward, there can be no doubt. It
must have been nearly in the same line that another celebrated journey was accom-
plished in much less time·, that of Queen Mary, from Jedburgh to Hermitage Castle,
and back again, on the 16th of October 1566.

In Edward's subsequent progress from the Border, to Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and
Stirling, as detailed in the Itinerary, there occur no topographical obscurities. On
Wednesday the 20th of June, he crossed the Forth (mer d’Escosse) on the route to
Perth, (Saint Jehan de Perte,) where he arrived on the following day, having rested
at a place variously written in the manuscripts, (Outrear, Outreart, outreard.,) and pro-

Advancing onward, Edward crossed the Tay at the royal castle of Kinclevin ς
(Kinclouen, Kynge Colomen‚) proceeded next day to the royal castle of Clony or Cluny,
the extensive foundations of which may still be traced near the lake of that name ς and
after remaining there for several days, he again set out on the ed of July, and rested
at the royal castle of Inverqueich on the borders of Perthshire and Forfarshire,
(Eutrekoic chastea) of which the ruins are still extant. From thence he proceeded to
the Castle of For-far ; to Fernwel, in the neighbourhood of Montrose, and to Montrose,
(Mounros chastel et bonne ville,) where he sojourned from Saturday the 7th till Wed-
nesday the 1 lth of July.

Pursuing his journey northward, he then advanced to Kincardine in the Mem-ns,
and on the two following days effected a laborious passage across the Grampian moun-
tains‚ by Glenbervie, (Glombermie) to a place corruptedly written Danaes or Darna,
probably Durris‚ on the south bank of the river Dee ς described in the manuscripts

or beyond the Mounth. His subsequent progress to Aberdeen, Kintore‚ (Kin-
