NOTE.

There are preserved in the British Museum two copies of the preceding Itinerary,
written in old Norman French, which differ little from each other excepting in their
modes of mis-spelling the names of places. One of these (Cott. MSS. Nero, D. vi. 18.)
was followed in an edition contained in the Bannatyne Miscellany, (Vol. 1. p. 271.)
The >other (Cott. MSS. Domitian xviii.) has been adopted as the text of that here
printed, with a few obvious corrections derived from the former. There are also
extant several copies of an old English version, exhibiting some further varieties of
topographical spelling, but from which little aid in the correction of errors can be
derived One of these also (Cott. MSS. Vespasian‚ C. xvi. 16.) is printed in the
Bannatyne Miscellany3 another in the Harleian Library (No. 1309) has been printed
in the Archaelogia, (Vol. xxi, p. 498‚) with copious and valuable ‘illustrations by Sir
Harris Nicolas; and two other copies, apparently of inferior value, are preserved
in the British Museum, (Addit. MSS. No. 5758,) and in the Ashmolian Collection
at oxford (No. 865.) ’

In all of these copies the names of places have been strangely disfigured by the local
ignorance of the writer, who, in spelling, appears to have been guided chiefly by the
ear 3 and it is accordingly by means of an appeal to the same organ, that some of his
wildest deviatione from the usual orthography are to be traced and corrected. As the
greater number of these have been already pointed out, in the Archaelogia by Sir
Harris Nicolas, and in the Bannatyne Miscellany by Mr. Tytler‚ very little now remains

to be done.

' From the entry of Edward into Scotland on the 27th of March 1296, aster crossing
the T weed at Coldstream, till his departure from Roxburgh Castle on Wednesday the
23d of May, no topographical difficulties will be found. He then set out on a rapid
expedition into Liddesdale ; stopping at Jedburgh (Gydmord) on that day3 at “ WyeC'
