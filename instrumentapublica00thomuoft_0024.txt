In the following instanees, a more definite import seems plainly
indicated. Thus, in Fordun’s account of an extensive conspiracy of
the Scottish nobles for resisting the attempts of David ΙΙ. to intro-
duce an English prince into the succession to the crown, it is added,
“ Et ne quis illorum ab illo proposito resiliret, editae sunt indenturoe
‘⁶ ragmannicoe hincinde firmiter roboratae ;” or, in the words of an-

other copy of this chronicle, ‘⁶ literoe ragmannicoe sigillis· firmiter

“ roboratae.’' (Scotickronicon, lib. xiv. cap. 25.)

In the first parliament of Henry IV. a petition was presented by
the Commons of England‚ setting forth that the city of London, and
many counties and towns, had been violently constrained by king
Richard to grant under seal certain writs and blank charters, (⁴⁶ d'en-
“ sealer diverses escriptz et blanches chartres,'’) to the great detri-
ment of their state and liberties, and praying that these might be
annulled; and it was accordingly decreed in parliament‚ “ que toutes
“ les remembrances appellez Raggemans ou blanches chartres nadgairs
“ enseallez en la citee de Londres,” &c. should cease to be of any
force or value in all time to come. (Rot. Parl. iii. 432.) And in
pursuance of this decree a precept was issued to the sheriff of Kent,
which is entitled in the Close roll “ de Bag-mannis comburendis,”
commanding the immediate destruction of these extorted deeds,
which are described as “ diversa scripta cartas sive literas patenteS,
“ vocata Raggemans sive Blank chartreS, sigillis eorundem subdi-

“ torum separatim consignata, et in cancellaria ipsius nuper regis
