genuine statistical notices of the kingdom towards the close of the
thirteenth century.

It may be proper to mention that the reeords which have been em-
ployed in this compilation have no particular titles inscribed on them,
and that those here prefixed have been adopted from the language of
the instruments themselveS, as sufficiently descriptive of their nature
and contentS. They are the same instruments that have been usually
known under the uncouth appellation of the Ragman Rolls3 a word,
the original and proper meaning of which has not been very clearly
ascertained, and as to which it is not here intended to offer any con-
fident opinion. Its occurrence in English history and in legal records,
as well as in other compositions, although not very frequent, is by
no means singular, and from these its usual and more exact import

may be conjectured.

In the English Statute Book, an Act of the fourth year of Edward Ι.
is entitled‚ in the only copy of it now extant, ‘⁶ Statutum de J usti-
‘⁶ ciariis assignandiS, quod vocatur Rageman ;'' (Statutea of the Realm,
Vol. i. p. 44.) but neither in the form nor tenour of the act is there
any obvious reason sor that very peculiar appellation; and spelman,
who quotes no other exemplification of the word, is contented with

describing it as the title of a particular statute.
