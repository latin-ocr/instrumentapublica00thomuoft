wald thou this buke 1 suld to the declam,
Quhilk war impossibill til expreme-at schorte;
Virgill it full of sentence over all quhare,

Bot here intill, as Servius can propone,

His hie knawlege he shawis, that every sorte

Of his clausis comprehend sic sentence,

Thare bene thereof, set thou think this bot spone,
Made grete ragmentis of hie intelligence.

Prologue to Book ,πὶ-τίῆ, p. 158.

Thy buke is bot bribry‚ said the berne than,

Bot 1 sal lere the ane lessoun to leis al thy pane:

With that he raucht me ane roll: to rede Ι begane,
The royetest ane ragment with mony ratt rime,

Of all the mowis in this mold, sen God merkit man,

The moving of the mapamound, & how the mone schane,
The pleuch, and the poles, the planettis began,

The son, the sevin sternis, and the Charle wane,

The elwand, the elementis, and Arthuris huffe,

The horne and the hand staffe,
Prater Jhone and port J affe,

Quhy the corne has the caffe,
And kow weris clufe.

Prologue to the eighth Book, p. 239.

These instances seem to prove that at the beginning of the six-
teenth century the word was applied to compositions of a very mis-
cellaneous sort, and- far different from those solemn and technical
deeds ‘co which it was appropriated at an earlier period. This may
be further illustrated by its use in the first stanza of Sir David
Lindnay's “ Answer to the Kingis Flyting.'’
